    <Accordion title="Why don't I see X integration?" icon="plug">
        If you don't see an integration, it's either because it's not available or it's not enabled for your company.
        If an integration is disabled, reach out to your admin to enable it. Otherwise reach out to [support@knowkr.app](mailto:support@knowkr.app) to request a new integration..
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="Why don't I see my task?" icon="list">
        KnowKR syncs tasks periodically throughout the day so updates may take some time to reflect in KnowKR. They should not take longer than an hour to appear.
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="Why are all my tasks under review?" icon="eye">
        If many of your tasks are under review it likely means that your activities (tasks, meetings, docs, etc) lack sufficient context or are missing goal tags for KnowKR to automatically assign them to the appropriate goal.

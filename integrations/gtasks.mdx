## How it works

KnowKR's AI will scan all the tasks inside Google Tasks and do the following:

1. Create a corresponding task in KnowKR based on the task title
2. Assign it to tbe appropriate goal by analyzing the task title and description. If the task title or description contains a goal tag, KnowKR will automatically assign the task to that goal otherwise it will do its best to assign it to the appropriate goal based on the context.

## How to Update Tasks

When you update a task in ClickUp, KnowKR will automatically update the corresponding task in KnowKR. This way, you can easily see your progress towards goals without manually needing to update them.
Tasks update periodically throughout the day so if you make a change in ClickUp, it may take some time to reflect in KnowKR.

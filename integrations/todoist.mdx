The Todoist integration allows you to automatically create and update tasks in KnowKR from Todoist.
This integration is perfect for teams that use Todoist to manage their projects and want to keep track of their progress towards business goals and objectives.

## How to Integrate KnowKR with Todoist

    <Step title="Navigate to the Integrations Page">
        Navigate to the Integrations page on the KnowKR Dashboard.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Get Connected">
        Click on the "Connect" button for the Todoist integration and follow the instructions to connect your Todoist account to KnowKR.
    </Step>
    <Step title="That's It">
        If you have any tasks assigned to you in Todoist, KnowKR will automatically create corresponding tasks for you.
    </Step>
</Steps>

## How it works

KnowKR's AI will scan all the tasks assigned to you in Todoist and do the following:

1. Create a corresponding task in KnowKR based on the task title
2. Assign it to tbe appropriate KR by analyzing the task title and description. If the task title or description contains a KR tag, KnowKR will automatically assign the task to that KR otherwise it will do its best to assign it to the appropriate KR based on the context.

## How to Update Tasks

When you update a task in Todoist, KnowKR will automatically update the corresponding task in KnowKR. This way, you can easily see your progress towards KRs without manually needing to update them.
Tasks update periodically throughout the day so if you make a change in Todoist, it may take some time to reflect in KnowKR.

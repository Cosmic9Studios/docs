## Installation & Setup (Admin Only)

Quickly install the Slack extension by following the steps below:

<Steps>
    <Step title="Add to Slack">
        Go the Admin page on the dashboard and click on the "Add to Slack" button in the header. Follow the instructions to install the Slack extension.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Create a channel">
        Inside your Slack workspace, create a new public channel where all Vork activity will be posted Eg. #vork-activity.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Activate the channel">
        Inside the newly created channel, type `/vork activate` to activate the channel for Vork activity. Now all Vork activity (shoutouts, goals, etc) will be posted to this channel.
    </Step>
</Steps>

## Sending Shoutouts

If the Vork bot is installed in your Slack workspace, you can send shoutouts to your team members using the `/vork shoutout` command. You can send a shoutout from any channel in your Slack workspace.

<Info>**Example:** /vork shoutout @user for helping me complete project x.</Info>

## Sending Kudos

By adding a reaction to any activity item in the activity channel, Vork will automatically send a kudos to the user. You have 5 kudos to give out each day.

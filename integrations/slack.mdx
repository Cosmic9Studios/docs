## Sending Shoutouts

If the KnowKR bot is installed in your Slack workspace, you can send shoutouts to your team members by telling the KnowKR bot you want to do a shoutout `@KnowKR shoutout @person for [reason]`. You can send a shoutout from any channel in your Slack workspace.

<Info>**Example:** @KnowKR shoutout @user for helping me complete project x.</Info>

## Sending Kudos

By adding a reaction to any activity item in the activity channel, KnowKR will automatically send a kudos to the user. You have 5 kudos to give out each day.

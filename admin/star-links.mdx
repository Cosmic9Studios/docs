Star links are single use links that allow you to grant stars on an ad-hoc basis. There are examples listed below to demonstrate how you can leverage this feature.

## Creating Star Links

<Steps>
    <Step title="Create Link">
        Navigate to Admin > Star Links and click on the Add New button.
    </Step>

    <Step title="Enter Required fields">
        | Field | Description                           |
        | -------- | ------------------------------------- |
        | Name     | The name to identify the link by (just for reference)                  |
        | Access   | The individuals who can use the link (it defaults to Everyone, but you can select specific individuals)                         |
        | Log Message Format   | This is what will be shown on the activity log when an individual clicks on the link. If you put `@user` in the text, it will put the individuals name there in the activity log |

        <Info>If you put `@user presented in the monthly all hands meeting` and “Sally May” clicks on the link. The activity log will show: `Sally May presented in the monthly all hands meeting`</Info>

        <Note>You are not required to use the `@user` variable so if you want to keep it confidential you can put something like: “Someone completed a survey”.</Note>
    </Step>

    <Step title="Generate & Send">
        Click the Generate and Copy button. This will copy the link to your clipboard. Send the link to the individuals via any communication mechanism ie. Slack, Teams, Email, etc.
    </Step>
</Steps>

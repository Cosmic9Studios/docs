You can edit all the details associated with an employee by clicking the toggle edit button. Values get saved as soon as you make a change.

## Fields you can edit

#### Manager

Use the dropdown to edit the individuals manager. The manager is used across the platform from the activity log to automations.

#### Role

You can change someone’s role to Member, Admin or Owner. Admin’s can access the admin tab and everything else on the platform. And owner has all admin privileges and can delete anyone including other owners. If the role is “Pending” it means a user hasn’t accepted the invite.

#### Start Date

This is the employees start date at your company. It is optional and is only used in the work anniversary automation.

#### Birthday

This is the employees birth date. It is optional and is only used in the birthday automation.

#### Actions Menu (delete users)

You can click on the actions button (three dots) to open a menu. In the menu you can delete users. Deleting users wipes all information (including stars) and isn’t reversible so use with caution.

## Fields you can’t edit

Name and email are the only fields you can’t edit. If you need to change these fields you can delete the user and re-invite them.

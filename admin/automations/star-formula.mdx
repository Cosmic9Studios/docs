Stars Formulas allow you to customize how stars are issued with KnowKR automations. This feature is available in automations that issue stars, boosts, or other rewards.

## How to Use Star Formulas

It may seem a bit daunting at first, but it's actually quite simple. You can use basic math operators such as `+`, `-`, `*` (multiply), `/`, `^` (exponents), `()` and more to create formulas. You can also use variables that are unique to each automation.


### Variables

Certain automations come with variables that you can use in your formulas. Variables are always preceded by the `@` symbol and represent a value that can be used in your formula.

For example, the Birthday Automation comes with the `@age` variable. This variable represents the age of the person who has a birthday. If you wanted to give the person 5 stars for every year they've been alive, you could use the formula `@age * 5`.

### Basic Math Operators

As mentioned earlier, you can use basic math operators to create formulas. Here are some examples:

- `+` (addition)
- `-` (subtraction)
- `*` (multiplication)
- `/` (division)
- `^` (exponents - e.g. `2^3` is 2 to the power of 3)
- `()` (parentheses - e.g. `(2 + 3) * 4`)

### Conditionals

You can also use conditionals in your formulas. Conditionals allow you to execute different formulas based on a condition. Conditionals are written in the following format: `condition ? formula1 : formula2`.

For example, if you wanted to give someone 10 stars if they are older than 30 and 5 stars if they are younger than 30, you could use the formula `@age > 30 ? 10 : 5`.

Here are some examples of conditionals:

- `>` (greater than)
- `<` (less than)
- `>=` (greater than or equal to)
- `<=` (less than or equal to)
- `==` (equal to)
- `!=` (not equal to)

### Advanced Operators

These are rarely used, but you can also use the following advanced operators in your formulas:

- `!` (factorial - e.g. `5!` is 5 factorial)
- `sqrt()` (square root - e.g. `sqrt(25)` is the square root of 25)
- `abs()` (absolute value - e.g. `abs(-5)` is the absolute value of -5)
- `round()` (round to the nearest integer - e.g. `round(5.5)` is 6)
- `pi` (the value of pi)
- `%` (modulus OR remainder - e.g. `5 % 2` is 1)

## Please Note

If you enter an invalid formula (ie. Division by zero), the automation will issue 0 stars so be sure to validate your formulas before saving.

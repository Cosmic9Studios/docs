<Note> It does take a bit of work to configure the Survey Tracker and we currently only support Google Forms. If you want a faster or alternative way to reward survey completions visit the [Star Links](/admin/star-links) page. Scroll down to learn more about the differences between star links and the survey tracker.</Note>

## Star Links vs Survey Tracker

You may be asking yourself: What’s the point of the Survey Tracker, isn’t it just Star Links with more steps?

The main difference with the survey tracker and Star links is that it prevents employees from attempting to game the system on survey completions. If you share Star Links at the end of survey, an employee can share that same link with another employee who hadn’t completed the survey and they would still get the stars.

With the Survey Tracker that’s not possible because Vork’s AI checks the actual survey responses for the unique code meaning the employee must reach the end of the survey to enter their code.

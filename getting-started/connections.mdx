Connections are integrations with tools you use for work such as calendars, task managers, and more. By connecting these tools to Vork, you can passively earn stars when Vork's AI detects positive actions.

<Info>**Disclaimer:** Connection data is never stored on Vork's servers. It is only used to passively earn stars when Vork's AI detects positive actions.</Info>

## Adding a Connection

Connections can be added from the Connections page in the Vork app. If you don't see any connections, it means that your organization has not enabled any connections yet.

<Steps>
    <Step title="Configuring the connection">
        Certain connections may require you to configure them before you can add them to Vork. For example, you will need to input your working hours for the calendar connection to work properly.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Get Connected">
        Once you have configured the connection, you can add it to Vork by clicking on the button of the app you want to connect to. You will be prompted to log in to the service and grant Vork access to the necessary data.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Profit">
        Based on the data from the connected service, Vork's AI will passively earn stars when it detects positive actions.

Workflows put your Key Result progression on autopilot. When a workflow is attached to a Key Result it will automatically update your progress so you don't have to.
This means you can focus on your work and allow KRs to fully manage themselves.

## How Workflows Work

Workflows run at specific intervals that you specify. Their only job is to update the progress of your Key Results, by getting the latest measurement for your Key Result, for example:
If you have a Key Result to reduce the number of bugs by 50%, you can attach a workflow that runs every X days to get the latest number of bugs and update your progress automatically.

## Creating Workflows

Workflows can be created in the Key Result creation wizard (or edit screen). When you create a Key Result you will be asked how you would like to track your Key Result, you can choose to track it manually or automatically with a workflow.

## Types of Workflows

There are two types of workflows in KnowKR:

#### AI Workflows

You can choose to have KnowKR automatically track your Key Result using AI. All you have to do is describe what you want to track and KnowKR will attempt to built a workflow that will track your Key Result for you.

For example: If you want to track the number of bugs in Jira you can type "Track the number of bugs in Jira" and KnowKR will attempt to build a workflow that will track the number of bugs in Jira for you.

Based on the prompt you provide, KnowKR may ask you for additional information to build the workflow. **Please refrain from providing any sensitive information.**

#### Pre-built Workflows

These are workflows that are pre-built by KnowKR and are ready to use. You can choose from a list of pre-built workflows when creating a Key Result and KnowKR will automatically track your Key Result for you.

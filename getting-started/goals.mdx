## What are Goals in Vork?

Goals are the building blocks of success. They are quantifiable targets that help you to focus on what is important and to prioritize your work.

## How Goals Work

You can create and share goals with anyone in your organization. Each goal includes tasks that need to be completed to reach the desired outcome.
Additionally, goals can be linked to Objectives, allowing you to quantify and track your progress towards them or they can be linked to other goals to show relationships between them.

## Automatic Tracking

A common problem with goal setting is tracking your progress. Vork solves this problem by automatically tracking your goal progression. This is done through tags and AI.

When goals are created in Vork, tags are created so that you can tag your activities with the goal you're working on. Below is a breakdown of how it works:

*Scenario:* Let's say you have a group goal to ship a new feature by the end of the month, and the feature is called "Feature X". Let's say Feature X has 3 tags: `feature-x`, `feature-x-dev`, and `feature-x-qa`.

As you work on Feature X, you can tag your tasks, meetings, documents, etc with one of the 3 tags by adding it to the title, description, comments, etc. Vork will then automatically keep track of events that are associated with the tags.

For example, when you complete a task, it will automatically be logged in Vork or when a meeting has been completed, it will also be logged. This way, you can easily see your progress towards goals without manually needing to update them.
